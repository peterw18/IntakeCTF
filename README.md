# IntakeCTF

IntakeCTF is a CTF ran by Warwick Cyber Security Society for new first-years, in October.
It is beginner-friendly and designed to introduce students to CTFs.

## IntakeCTF 2024
I developed three challenges at the end of my first-year, for the new freshers.
Including:
- Join the Wild Hunt (Web, JWT cracking)
- Request Rumble (Web, request spoofing)
- LinkedIn LARPing (OSINT, security questions)
